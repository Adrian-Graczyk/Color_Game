Executor: "Captain, why do I also see objects in color in my visual system?"

Captain: "I don't fully understand it myself. I'm not a technician. From what I know, it might be related to the genetic trace left by people with malfunctioning implants on those objects. At the same time, it could be some system glitches. Remember, this is still prototype technology. Instead of dwelling on it, use it to adjust the implant reset mode in your weapon accordingly. Your weapon should automatically retrieve the necessary data from the object in the corresponding color upon physical contact. You can also pick up an object, charge it, and throw it at the enemy, that should work too."

Executor: "Thank you for the information, Captain."

Captain: "And remember..."

"..."

Executor: "Hello, Captain?"

Resistance Leader: "Greetings, Executor (pff, did you come up with that yourself?). I only have a moment, so I'll be quick. The Party you serve is an organization full of secrets and lies. And we can free you from the control they exert over you."

Executor: "I am not controlled. I am loyal, and my loyalty belongs entirely to the Party. You won't convince me to betray it, so you can stop trying. Hmm, who are you, anyway?"

Resistance Leader: "I am the one you're tasked to find and most likely kill, but that's not important right now. Can't you see that you're a tool in the hands of others? Haven't you ever wondered what truly goes on in the Party?"

Executor: "It is not my role to ask questions. I am here to follow orders."

Resistance Leader: "It doesn't have to be that way. I can help you. I can give you information about what truly happens within the Party. You'll see that it's not what you th.."

Executor: "..Fuck off."

"..."

Executor: "Captain, can you hear me?"

Captain: "Yes, I can now. What happened?"

Executor: "The resistance leader hacked into our communication link."

Captain: "What did she want from you?"

Executor: "She tried to convince me to abandon the mission. I terminated the connection before she could start her persuasion."

Captain: "Oh, I see. In that case, next time, listen to what she has to say. It might be useful to us. We'll also try to trace her location during the next conversation. Draw it out as long as possible if you get the chance."

Executor: "Understood, Captain."

Captain: "Now go and reset the next group of rebels who have taken over rooftops in the city. Michel, over and out."
