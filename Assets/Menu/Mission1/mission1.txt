Executor: "Reporting, Captain. I am ready to carry out the mission."

Captain: "Excellent, Executor. Your task is to suppress the rebellion and put an end to the terrorist attacks in the city. You will locate the group leaders and eliminate them.
You have a prototype solution in your helmet that allows you to detect malfunctioning implants. Individuals with such implants will appear in vibrant colors through your visual system, reflecting the emotions responsible for their implant's destruction. Initially, this sensory input may be overwhelming, but you will acclimate to it in due time.

Executor: "Understood, Captain. Am I allowed to use firearms?"

Captain: "Yes, but listen carefully. This time your objective is to reset the implants, not to kill people. We have provided you with a weapon capable of accomplishing that. A single strike with either the sword or gun will transmit an impulse that restores the implants to their functional state. The reset process induces unconsciousness for several hours, so you need not worry about managing the affected individuals."

Executor: "Acknowledged. I will act according to the rules."

Captain: "Good. We cannot afford unnecessary human casualties. Remember that growing social unrest is undesirable for the Party, and it requires us to be more cautious.
Of course, this does not apply to the rebel leaders. In their case, we cannot take any risks. The rebels have become audacious enough to attack one of our facilities. You must retake it."

Executor: "Certainly, Captain. I won't disappoint."

Captain: "I have no doubt about that. You have always been exceptionally effective in your missions. Michel, over and out."
